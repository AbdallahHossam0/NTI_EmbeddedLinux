1- on script bash on the same folder


2- ls /usr/bin /usr/sbin > UsrCommands

3- you can do that by changing the .profile bash script

4- wc => wc -l UsrCommands


5- a. only the second file apprears, do cat file1 file2 instead
b. it will delete all the content of the folder -expected-, it is not working  do rm * instead
c. 1 => the output is of one line

6. find / -name ".profile" => it will need the sudo permisiions 

7. ls -i   [-i] to show the inodes

8. ln -s => softlink => Failed permission denied (need sudo and it will work)

9. ln => hard link => Operation not permitted // they are different partions (can't do hard link between different directies) 

10. for multi line commands 
you can edit the > to : in the .bashrc using echo 'PS1=": "' to be executed each time you open the terminal "it is called the default secondary prompt in many Unix/Linux Shells [the bash also provides that]"
you need to rerun the ./.bashrc to make the edits run
